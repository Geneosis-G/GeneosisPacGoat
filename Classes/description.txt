[b]KNOWN BUGS[/b]
- Pac-Dots/Power Pellets can be generated in unreachable areas: Yes, but thanks to the 2D rule you can still catch them if you manage to align horizontally with them.
- After eating a Ghost, you can rarely lose one life: This happen if the Ghost you just ate respawn really close to you, to avoid that try to remember where each Ghost spawn.
- The goat might have glitchy animations during countdown (can heppen if the countdown started when the goat was ragdolled): fixes itself after a few seconds.

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Another wonderful suggestion born in the request thread :) First I had some arguments not to make that mod because of how inaccurate it could be to adapt an originally 2D game in a 3D universe... But I figured out a way to keep most of the original gameplay while having it more goaty :p
So first of all you might have noticed the "arena limits" from Super Smash Goats, actually the whole mechnaic to enter and leave the Pac-Goat game mode are also taken from this mod to gain some time ^^
Then we have the Pac-Dots and Power Pellets that use the same basic structure as the Sonic Rings, but with a cube and a sphere painted in flat white texture.
Finally the hardest part in there: the Ghosts, and more precisely their AI... Contrary to most of the other enemy AI I made this one is quite strong as it won't let the Ghost go ragdoll, which means it is hard to move with pushing force effects but as well easier to manoeuver in the game world (as it won't fall apart every time it trip on a little item on its way). To make it even stronger it cannot be grabbed by the goat tongue and the "2D game rule" make it able to touch the player even if it's only aligned with him vertically and not actually touching him. FInally I came up with a "try not to be stuck" algorithm that feels a bit more efficient than the one i used in previous AIs so I'm happy with this one :)
